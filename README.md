Analysis for SIR Models with Vaccinations.

# Experiment 1: Dynamic of the population under social optimum and mean-field equilibrium

In this experiment, we fix the parameters and we observe evolution of the dynamics of the system for the social optimum and the mean-field equilibrium. 

## Required Software

* Matlab 2014 or higher
* Octave 3.8.1 or higher

## Running the examples

Execute region_plot.m file

## Output 

A figure with three areas that determine when the mean-field equilibrium and the social optimum vaccinate with maximum rate and with minimum rate and with a dashed line (resp. solid line) the evolution of the mean-field equilibrium (resp. social optimum).

# Experiment 2: Comparison of the thresholds of the social optimum and of the mean-field equilibrium when c_V varies

## Required Software

* Python 2.7.6

## Running the examples

Execute scr.sh in a terminal

## Output

A file called data.txt with 5 columns and in each row the output obtained for each c_V. In the first column, there is the value of c_V, in the second and the third one, the value of the threshold and the cost of the mean-field equilibrium and in the forth and the fifth one, the value of the threshold and the cost of the social optimum.

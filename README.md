This repository contains all the codes to reproduce 
the numerical experiments of the paper A Mean Field Game 
Analysis for SIR Models with Vaccinations.

- To create Figure 2: execute in Matlab plot_region_trajec_ms04_mi04.m

- To create Figure 3: execute the code of the notebook SIR-thr-comparison.ipynb

- To create Figure 4: execute the code in Matlab cost_Nfinite_mfe.m
Note: to create the plotted data, execute the code of the notebook SIR-MFG-vs-Nplayergame.ipynb

- To create Figure 5: execute in Matlab switchingcurve_Nfinite_mfeq.m
Note: the required values to create the figure are available in the data folder.  
To create the plotted data, execute the code of the notebook SIR-MFG-vs-Nplayergame.ipynb

- To create Figure 6: execute in Matlab cost_Nfinite_mfopt.m

- To create Figure 7: execute in Matlab switchingcurve_Nfinite_mfopt.m

- To create Figure 8-9: execute the code of the notebook PoA_plotPython.ipynb
Note: the required values to create the figure are available in the data folder. To create 
the plotted data, execute the code of the notebooks Efficiency_Napprox.ipynb and 
Efficiency_Nfinite.ipynb as well as in Matlab global_optimum_Nfinite.m

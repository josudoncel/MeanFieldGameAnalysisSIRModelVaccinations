## Notes:

- Some of the notebooks load the data of all the policies (mean-field equilibrium, 
N-players equilibrium, mean-field optimum and global optimum with N finite), 
which is contained in the folder data. To generate this data , execute the
code of the notebook compute_policy_t0.ipynb and to create new data, use the same
notebook

- The code of the file computation_mfg.py is used in most of the notebooks.

- Some npy files in the data folder must be uncompressed.

Note 1:
Some of the notebooks load the data of all the policies (mean-field equilibrium, 
N-players equilibrium, mean-field optimum and global optimum with N finite), 
which is contained in the folder data. To generate this data, execute the
code of the notebook compute_policy_t0.ipynb

Note 2: 
The code of the file computation_mfg.py is used in most of the notebooks.
